nCore for CouchPotato

## How to install
- Download the zip or tar archive.
- You need to have CouchPotato installed to be able to do the following steps.
- You need to create a directory called `ncore` in the custom_plugins folder of the CouchPotato root folder
- This specific folder can be found on linux at `/home/username/.couchpotato/` and on windows at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\CouchPotato` or `C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\CouchPotato`
- After you have created the `ncore` folder, then you have to extract/put the files main.py and __init__.py to this folder
- After this step you have to restart CouchPotato if you have had it already running
- Now if everything worked well, you will see the new Searcher in the `Settings->Searcher` tab of the web frontend

## How to use
- After you have completed the above steps you have to click on the nCore button in the list of Searchers
- After the clicking it will ask you for your username and password
- Fill this out accordingly to your nickname and pass on the tracker
- CouchPotato is authenticating you to our servers and it does not store the password anywhere
- Now if you've filled out the details correctly you are ready to search and add your own interests
- If you have found your favorite movie, CouchPotato should scan nCore too now
